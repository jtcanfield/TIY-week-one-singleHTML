Using Mac, The Flexbox code I have in right now only seems to be working on chrome and opera. In Firefox, the flexboxes are there, but padding and margins of them are not. In Safari, only the homepage flexboxes are acting up and are not "align-self"ing correctly. If you have any tips, let me know! (not checked on IE)
